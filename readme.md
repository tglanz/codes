## Repo outline
directories at the top level indicate the the environment; not necessarily the language.

for example, currently there is a _maven_ directory, it means that the project has maven's structure and while now there is only java code, we might add scala or some other language.

another example, a similiar environment setup can be a _dotnet core_ project, with c#, f# etc...

each project will have a readme of it's own on how to use it (building, running testing etc...)
